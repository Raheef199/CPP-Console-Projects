## A small oop based queue line console project that i have made to strengthen my oop knowledge and apply it on a real-world example

It is similar to a machine that exists at banks or telephone companies etc.. that issues a ticket as soon as the customer enters the building 
based on the type of service a user wants to do

## How it Works:

- In the main all you need to do is create an instance of object type by naming it as you want but preferably service related name and
  assign constructor parameters of (Prefix or Code , Expected duration for each service)

- Prefix is of type "string" and Duration is of type "int"

- then call the different methods that exist in the object to get a look on how it works!
